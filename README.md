# RabbitMQ-Tutorial-Perl

The RabbitMQ tutorial at http://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html doesn't include Perl. There is one at https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-tutorials/tree/master/perl, but it uses [http://p3rl.org/Net::RabbitFoot](Net::RabbitFoot), which doesn't work with Perl 5.24. It looks like [http://p3rl.org/Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ](Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ) is the most up-to-date Perl module for RabbitMQ, so I'm going to try doing the tutorial with that.
